# Python-ML-MultipleRegression
This is a repository for a Python project for Predicting Customer Lifetime Value with Multiple Regression. 

Business Scenario:

An e-commerce company wants to predict the potential lifetime value (CLV) of its customers. They believe CLV is influenced by several numeric factors: the customer’s average purchase value, how frequently they purchase, and how long they’ve been a customer. The task is to build an MLR model to predict CLV based on these factors.

This assignment focuses on applying Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) to a common business problem: predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). I will use Python and relevant libraries to build, interpret, and evaluate an MLR model using synthetic customer data.
